Problem Statement : -
Students have difficulties in understanding  Graphs and various Sorting algorithms. 
Various sorting techniques have many linked methodologies which can be remembered 
but the concepts get faded in the memory after some time. Same thing happens with 
the concepts of graphs, also graphs require precision, the more precise graphs are 
made the more accurate results are formed. Manually such accuracy cannot be achieved
at all the points.

Solution : -
Fading of once learned concepts can be forgotten if things are learned visually. 
When we speak of graphs and sorting methods, both require precision and good 
visualization. VISUALIZER enables the students to learn the concepts of both 
graphs and sorting methods by visualizing them instead of mugging up the process.
